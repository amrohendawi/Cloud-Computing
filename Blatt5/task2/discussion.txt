1) Which steps in your program require communication and synchronization between your workers?

The master reads the input data and distributes it to the worker nodes. For this step communication is required.
Additionally, the groupBy command requires communication.
In the end the workers need to be synchronized to form one output file out of the generated results.


2) What resources is the job bound by? Memory? CPU? Network? Disk?

The job is bound by all 4 component:
1- The execution of the job is bound by the workers' CPU, since the data processing load is on the CPU.
2- During the processing of the data the job is also bound by the memory, which can form a bottleneck if the data is large enough.
3- The job is bound by the network in terms of communication and synchronization between the nodes, e.g. merging the file data sink.
4- The input data needs to be loaded and the output data needs to be stored. This is bound by the disk speed and free space.

Overall, the CPU represents the largest bottleneck.



3) Could you improve the partitioning of your data to yield better run-time?

The data could be stored on an HDFS system where it is stored in blocks. Doing so, the data could be read in parallel, thus reducing the runtime.
